## The Challenge

**Line Z of the Mexican railroad system** presented critical deficiencies in the Medias Aguas - Úbero section that limited its operational capacity and safety. The project required:

- **Geometric correction** of 56 km of inadequate curvature
- **Comprehensive rehabilitation** of 146.3 km of existing track
- **Strategic connection** to the Port of Salina Cruz to increase cargo flow
- Coordination with active railroad operations without completely stopping service

The complexity lay in executing millimeter-precision works in alignment and leveling while maintaining operational windows for commercial rail traffic.

## Technical Solution

### Track Geometric Correction

We implemented **topographic realignment procedures** using:

- Robotic total stations for geometry control (cant, horizontal and vertical alignment)
- Correction of curve radii according to AREMA (American Railway Engineering and Maintenance-of-Way Association) standards
- Cant transition adjustment for increased design speeds

### Infrastructure Rehabilitation

1. **Ballast renewal**: Replacement of degraded granular material
2. **Tie replacement**: Installation of high-strength prestressed concrete ties
3. **New rails**: Installation of 136 lb/yard rail for heavy traffic
4. **Drainage systems**: Reconstruction of minor drainage works and ditches

### Salina Cruz Port Connection

Design and construction of **railroad connections** linking the rehabilitated Line Z with port terminals, enabling:

- 40% increase in port cargo capacity
- Reduction of transit times for goods to central Mexico
- Interoperability with the modernized national railroad system

## Results

### Performance Metrics

| Indicator | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| **Rehabilitated length** | 146.3 km |
| **Curvature correction** | 56 km |
| **Investment** | Federal-level project (SEDENA/SCT) |
| **Execution period** | 2022-2023 (16 months) |
| **Geometric tolerance** | ±2 mm in horizontal alignment |

### Operational Impact

- **Increased speed**: From 40 km/h to 80 km/h on corrected curves
- **Load capacity**: Authorization for trains up to 120 cars
- **Safety**: 85% reduction in temporary speed restrictions
- **Connectivity**: Successful integration with Pacific port infrastructure
