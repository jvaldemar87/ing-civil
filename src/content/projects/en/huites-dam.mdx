## The Challenge

The **Huites Hydroelectric Dam**, located in the municipality of Choix, Sinaloa, represented one of Mexico's most ambitious hydraulic projects in the 1990s. The main challenge lay in:

- **Placement of over 3 million m³ of mass concrete** for the dam and spillway
- **Critical thermal control**: Mass concrete generates heat of hydration that can cause structural cracks
- **Innovative cooling procedures** not previously used in Mexico
- Coordination of a monumental civil work with strict execution deadlines

The size of the concrete volumes and the need to maintain long-term structural integrity made this project **unique worldwide** for its implemented placement methodology.

## Technical Solution

### Post-Cooled Concrete

We implemented an **embedded pipe cooling system**:

1. **Aggregate pre-cooling**: Temperature reduction of materials before mixing
2. **Cooling pipes**: Installation of coils within fresh concrete
3. **Refrigerated water circulation**: Continuous pumping to dissipate hydration heat
4. **Thermal monitoring**: Embedded thermocouples for real-time control of thermal gradients

### Placement Procedures

- **Alternating blocks**: Pouring in non-contiguous sequence to allow thermal dissipation
- **Controlled layers**: Maximum thickness of 1.5 m per lift
- **Waiting time between layers**: 7-14 days according to thermal analysis
- **Contraction joints**: Preventive design for crack control

### Quality Control

- Compressive strength tests every 50 m³
- Petrographic analysis of aggregates
- Adjusted dosing for optimal water/cement ratio (w/c < 0.45)
- Visual and ultrasound inspection of cold joints

## Results

### Project Magnitude

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Concrete volume** | 3,000,000+ m³ |
| **Dam height** | 162 m (approx.) |
| **Dam type** | Concrete gravity |
| **Reservoir capacity** | 3,137 million m³ |
| **Power generation** | 422 MW |

### Technical Innovation

✓ **First application in Mexico** of post-cooled concrete at this scale  
✓ **Zero structural cracks** in subsequent inspections  
✓ **Referenced methodology** in subsequent hydraulic projects  
✓ **Quality certification** exceeding CFE specifications  

### Regional Impact

- Electricity supply for **1.2 million inhabitants** of northwestern Mexico
- Flood control in the Fuerte River basin
- Development of road and communication infrastructure in the area
